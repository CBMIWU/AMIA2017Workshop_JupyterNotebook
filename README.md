This repository contains Jupyter notebook files and data required for the workshop, and PDF version of the slides used in the workshop at **AMIA Joint Summits 2017 in San Francisco on Wednesday, March 29, 2017**. Notebook files will become available on the day of the workshop, the PDF of presentation, will be uploaded within a few days after that. If you have any questions please submit an issue to this repo.

The Jupyter notebook files can be run on Jupyter Notebook application, with the requirement of data files being available in the same directory with the notebooks, however you must have all the necessary R packages installed. To run the notebooks, download the notebooks folder with all the included files, and run any of the .ipynb files inside Jupyter.
